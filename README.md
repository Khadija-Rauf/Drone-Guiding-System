# Drone-Guiding-System
It plots routes for a simple drone guidance system. The program plots the routes by following the instructions from a series of route guidance files.The program should continue to ask for the next route until requested to stop. 

The size of the grid to display is 12 x 12.  

The format of the route instructions file is as follows:  Item 1: X-Coordinate of start of route Item 2: Y-Coordinate of start of route Item 3 onwards: N, S, E, or W.

 The program outputs the completed route plot grid and the route coordinates, or the reason why the grid cannot be plotted.
 
 It only stop to ask for the filename of the next route instructions file, or when the instruction STOP is entered.
